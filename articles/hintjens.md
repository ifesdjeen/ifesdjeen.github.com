# Pieter Hintjens

I've met Pieter in 2014 on the way to the Coding Serbia conference. We were
standing waiting for the bus near Belgrade Airport to pick us up and bring to
Novi Sad. I knew who Pieter was, so I approached him and introduced myself and
we started talking on wide variety of subjects, from sciense and politics to
computer sciense and managing software teams. He carried multiple copies of
[Culture and Empire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GF48Z4S), which he handed out to anyone who was interested. He gave
his talk without having any slides. It felt as if he had a cheat sheet hidden
somewhere.

During the conference, he was sitting in hallways in his baseball hat and either
writing the next book or hacking some new project together. I've never met
another person so inspired and productive and trying to use every second of
their time. It seems that he has somehow cracked the code of life and figured
out how to make it meaningful. Something many other people lack. The only word
that keeps coming to my mind is "natural". Everything he decided to do seemed so
natural and he always turned out to be very good in it.

Second time we've met in Brussels, Belgium, on [EdgeNet](http://hintjens.com/blog:76) hackathon. During the day
we were sitting together with a group of enthusiasts discussing and building
some prototypes with [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/).

Third and the last time was in 2015 on the next Coding Serbia in Novi Sad. One
evening, it was much too loud on the official afterparty so we went from one bar
to the next one talking and observing people, making fun hypotheses about who
thinks what and why people act the certain way. It was always said in a fun and
positive form and most of the time his explanations of situations sounded very
plausible.

I got upset, when Pieter decided to leave Twitter. Several days later he made a
comeback to inform his friends about some bad news. When I first read it, I
could not believe it. I wanted to think it was some sort of social experiment,
that he's just observing how the people would react, and there will be a great
book about it and everything's going to end well. Turned out that I was right
about the book, but wrong about the rest.

His work and words inspired me a lot and helped me to make an important decision
at some point in my life. Hanging out with him was always fun and always good to
remember. He always gathered crowds of interesting people around him. There are
few people who have such natural charisma and are able to lead every
conversation, no matter which subject it involved, feel natural and fluent.

You could be always sure if you join him on bar crawl, conference discussion,
lunch, hack night, restaurant dinner, everyone's going to have great time and
remember this event for a long time.

Thank you Pieter. I'm very glad I've had a chance to meet you in person and hang
out. I'm always impressed by your productivity and passion. You've always been
a big inspiration and example for me.
