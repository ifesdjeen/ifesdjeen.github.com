## Year in Results

This year was a blast. We've started [Munich Lambda](www.meetup.com/Munich-Lambda/), a
user group for people interested in Functional Programming languages. Functional
programming is getting more and more attention every month, and there's a lot of people
who want to use FP at their working places.

When we first started, we knew about a dozen people in our area who were interested in
FP, and had no idea there're __so many__ people around who share our interests and mindset.

## Meetups

[First meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Lambda/events/126916132/) gathered over 50
people, and was hosted by GuteFrage. It was a very nice and promising start, since then
we were quite sure there's enough interest, and we should definitely continue.

Over the year, we had 4 meetups and 2 [Clojure Workshops](http://clojureworkshop.com/).
__Over a hundred__ people visited the meetups, and 35 came to the workshops. We had
talks on `Haskell`, `Clojure` (and `Lisp`), `OCaml`, `Scala` and `Erlang`. We've iterated
and been improving content and structure of our meetings, and have made many interesting
conclusions and plans for the next year.

## Functional Institute

First of all, I'm glad to announce a Functional Institute, an initiative we're starting
within Munich Lambda that pursues the next goals:

  * help people to steadily learn FP languages
  * build up a team that will be helping people to promote FP at their work
  * create a community of innovators

That may sound a bit pretentious, but we also have a plan for it. __Functional Institute__
will occur more frequently than usual meetups. Namely, twice a month. At the moment,
we have three languages we have some interest (and experts) for, which are Clojure,
Erlang and Haskell.

## Building a knowledge

__Every__ Functional Institute meetup will have it's own goal, for example: "build a simple
REST backend that talks to an SQL database and serves JSON results", or "write a
stream processing backend, aggregating events based on certain rules".

Participants will be __prepared__ for the meetup, have their text editors and development
environments ready to jump straight into the code. Inbetween meetups related to the same
language or topic, people will be able to get themselves to the state they're fluent in
the subject.

The __largest difficulty__ we've seen so far is that it's hard to find where to apply FP.
On the other hand, it's hard to learn without having a good, interesting and challenging
task. This is a chicken-egg problem.

Functional Institute will help people to __accumulate enough knowledge__ and experience
to start applying FP in production, over the year. By the end of year, everyone who
attended it, will be able to write large applications without any external help.

## Convincing employers

For the people already having some experience, we have a team that's able to
__investigate use-cases__ and __find good arguments__ on how FP will improve a situation
at their working places. FP is known for helping people to write software in a very
iterative, interactive way, reduce the error rate, having smaller, testable pieces
and using a Functional toolchain for working with collections.

All the good parts of Functional Programming sound "too good to be true" from time
to time, and many people advocate imperative languages due to an existing adoption,
but history shows us that not every big and popular thing is actually good. We'd
like avoid speaking cliches and taking a more practical and research-driven approach.
This way we can say not only "why FP is good", but "how __exactly__ FP is going to
help __your company__".

## Join us!

We're looking forward to the next year. Join our [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Lambda)
and let's see how we make it all happen! There are already some events scheduled for
first three months of 2013, and there will be even more coming next.

We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy Functional Year! See you soon!
