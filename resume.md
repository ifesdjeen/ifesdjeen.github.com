## Manifesto

 * Work with real people, rather than just professionals
 * Extend knowledge, understanding and vision every day, adjust my skills, learn new things, open-source some parts of my code, help other people to grow
 * Develop scalable, supportable, well-designed, implemented, tested, structured software, easy to extend, contribute to and keep up-to-date.
 * Be ready to change approach, when there's no reasonable way to scale/extend anymore.
 * Bring some fresh air to the team I work with, ease every existing process until the point it feels comfortable for each team member.
 * Write software and libraies that matter and help, are useful and easy to use.
 * Code and hack not for sakes of entropy, chaos and programming itself, but for product. Make just enough, not less or more.
