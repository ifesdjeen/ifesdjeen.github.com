## Manifesto

 * Work with real people, rather than just professionals
 * Extend knowledge, understanding and vision every day, adjust my skills, learn new things, open-source some parts of my code, help other people to grow
 * Develop scalable, supportable, well-designed, implemented, tested, structured software, easy to extend, contribute to and keep up-to-date.
 * Be ready to rewrite, when there's no reasonable way to scale/extend anymore.
 * Bring some fresh air to the team I work with, ease every existing process until the point it feels comfortable for each team member.
 * Write software and libraies that matter and help, are useful and easy to use.
 * Code and hack not for sakes of entropy, chaos and programming itself, but for product. Make just enough, not less or more.

### Good stuff that didn't get to the forementioned lists

  * AMQP, took a part in [jRuby Driver](http://github.com/ruby-amqp/hot_bunnies) and [Clojure Driver](http://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr)
  * ElasticSearch, wrote [Clojure Driver](http://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch) and [Ruby Driver](http://github.com/ifesdjeen/elastisch.rb), but latter one is not yet opensource).
