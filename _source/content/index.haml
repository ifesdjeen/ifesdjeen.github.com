    %h2 About
    %p
      Advanced Message Queuing Protocol is a standard wire-level protocol and semantic framework for high performance enterprise messaging.

    %h3
      From the AMQP website:
    %p
      AMQP is an Open Standard for Messaging Middleware.

    %p
      By complying to the AMQP standard, middleware products written for different platforms and in different languages can send messages to one another. AMQP addresses the problem of transporting value-bearing messages across and between organisations in a timely manner.
